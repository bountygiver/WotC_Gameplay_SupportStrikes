## Gameplay Features
- You can see how much intel the strike will use in Tactical by looking at the name of the ability. The brackets ([,]) has the current strike of the cost followed by the current intel resource that XCom has.
- The description of both the ability and GTS description displayes the costs of each consecutive use up to the maximum value (the right-most value), and resets to the initial value at the end of every month (the left-most value). The number colored in dark blue is the current cost of the Support Strike.
- All strikes do not work underground.
- If XCom does not have enough cost to cover a strike, the strike is disabled for that mission and future missions until XCom gains more Intel resource.
- For Helicopter Drop In, you can extensively edit the config file to drop in your own custom character pool characters and even their weapon.
